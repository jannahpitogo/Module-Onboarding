      <h1>WIREFRAME</h1>
      <p class="">
       A wireframe is a basic visual guide that outlines the structure and layout of a webpage or app interface. 
       It serves as a blueprint that shows where key elements such as buttons, menus, images, and text will be 
       placed, focusing on functionality and user flow rather than detailed design or color. Wireframes help 
       designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize the organization and hierarchy of content early in 
       the design process, ensuring that the user experience is well planned before moving on to high-fidelity 
       design and development.

        <h2>Significance of ReadMe File</h2>
        <p>
          The README file is a crucial component of any software project or repository, serving as the 
          primary source of information for users and contributors. It provides an overview of the 
          project’s purpose, features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution 
          processes. A well-written README helps others understand what the project does, how to set 
          it up, and how to use or contribute to it effectively. In professional development, it 
          enhances collaboration, improves project maintainability, and establishes credibility by 
          presenting the project in a clear, organized, and accessible manner.
