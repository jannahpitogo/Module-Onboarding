      <h1>WIREFRAME</h1>
      <p class="">
       A wireframe is a basic visual guide that outlines the structure and layout of a webpage or app interface. 
       It serves as a blueprint that shows where key elements such as buttons, menus, images, and text will be 
       placed, focusing on functionality and user flow rather than detailed design or color. Wireframes help 
       designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize the organization and hierarchy of content early in 
       the design process, ensuring that the user experience is well planned before moving on to high-fidelity 
       design and development.

        <h2>Significance of ReadMe File</h2>
        <p>
          The README file is a crucial component of any software project or repository, serving as the 
          primary source of information for users and contributors. It provides an overview of the 
          project’s purpose, features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution 
          processes. A well-written README helps others understand what the project does, how to set 
          it up, and how to use or contribute to it effectively. In professional development, it 
          enhances collaboration, improves project maintainability, and establishes credibility by 
          presenting the project in a clear, organized, and accessible manner.

        <h2>Significance of Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          The significance of a wireframe lies in its ability to provide a clear visual representation 
          of a website or application’s structure before any detailed design or development work begins. 
          It serves as a blueprint that outlines the layout, hierarchy, and functionality of key interface 
          elements, helping designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize how users will interact with 
          he product. Wireframes streamline the design process by identifying usability issues early, 
          ensuring alignment on layout and content placement, and saving time and resources during later 
          stages of development. In essence, a wireframe is an essential planning tool that bridges the 
          gap between concept and design execution.

        <h2>What is Git Branch?</h2>
        <p>
          A Git branch is an independent line of development within a Git repository. It allows developers 
          to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Each branch 
          represents a separate version of the project’s files and history, enabling multiple people to work 
          in parallel. Once the changes in a branch are tested and approved, they can be merged back into the 
          main branch (commonly called main or master). This branching system makes Git a powerful 
          tool for version control, collaboration, and maintaining clean, organized project development.
